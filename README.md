# Museum DB

This project is an example that shows usage of Docker in combination with Python and some visualization libraries.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Docker service running in your environment. 
If running a desktop system you can download Docker Desktop:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

You will also need Docker compose which has different ways of installation depending on your system and preferences:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Before proceeding to build step, make sure that Docker service is running.

## Build

Once you clone the repository you need to build the Docker images (make sure to cd into the cloned repo):
```
docker-compose build
```
Some images are larger so it can take few minutes for them to download and build.

## Run

Once the images are built, you can proceed by bringing up the containers:
```
docker-compose up
```

In the on-screen log you can see the components starting, including **backend**, **db** and **notebook**.
Make sure to copy the Jupyter notebook link and open it in browser.

Once the data are completely pulled and DB is created you should see something like:
```
backend_1   | Prepared data:
backend_1   |                                                Museum  ... Art/culture museum
backend_1   | 0                                              Louvre  ...               True
backend_1   | [69 rows x 16 columns]
museumdb_backend_1 exited with code 0
```

Open the notebook and try the provided examples.
If you need to see the notebook URL again, you can list it by getting the notebook container id and then running command inside of it.

For example:
```
$ docker ps | grep museumdb_notebook
670a5c1447c9        museumdb_notebook   "/bin/sh -c 'jupyterâ€¦"   51 minutes ago      Up 51 minutes       0.0.0.0:8585->8585/tcp              museumdb_notebook_1

$ docker exec -it 670a5c1447c9 jupyter notebook list

Currently running servers:
http://localhost:8585/?token=304359a18effef067afdc2a75ce4fe66cf93810c14cf7c8e :: /notebooks
```

Once you are done, you can put the containers down by running:
```
docker-compose down
```
